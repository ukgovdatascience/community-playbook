# How to organise a Data Science Community of Interest Meet Up

You can use the following sprints and process to plan a meet up.

Community Roadmap, should cover all of the dates for meet ups in a year. This process can also be adapted for adhoc meet ups.

## Sprint 1: Ideation 

Ask the community and consult the community chater on what topic(s) should be focused on. Develop a brief, this should include community needs, objectives, communications plan and current data science projects in the community. This should inform the core blocks of the meet up.

## Sprint 2: Collabration 

Once you have developed the brief ask for contributors from the community. Provide a speakers and team brief for the session.

## Sprint 3: Test 

If you event is virtual or you are using a facilitation technqiue you aren't used to test it our with colleagues and speakers.
Develop a contigency plan if colleaguges can't present e.g pre-recording or a reserve list

## Sprint 4: Sign Up and delivery

Create an eventbrite page, that informs attendees what to expect. Ensure you have a data privacy policy and you have asked attendees if they have any accesibility issues. 
Have a session production sheet so team members know what to do. 

## Sprint 5: Reflection and benefits realisation 

At the end of the meet up, ensure you have shared with members a feedback form. Take time to reflect on how the session went. Share materials from the meet up and catch up with speakers and members to understand their experince.
