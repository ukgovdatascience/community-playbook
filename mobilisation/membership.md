# Membership 

You can join the community as long as you belong and are currently working for a [UK Public Sector organisation](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations).

The community is primarily for data science practitioners and enablers. We welcome public sector colleagues who are interested in data science to join.

## Onboarding 

To join the [Government Data Science Slack](https://govdatascience.slack.com/) or [Knowledge Hub](https://khub.net/group/government-data-science-festival/group-library), you will need to sign up with a U.K public sector email address. 

For both platforms there are pre-approved list of email domains. 

### Government Data Science Slack 
As there are limited number of pre-approved emails either an admin or an existing member can invite you with your public sector email address.

You can do invite people through the following steps listed on the [slack help center](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/201330256-Invite-new-members-to-your-workspace#send-an-invitation).  

Once an invitation is sent, the admins will manually approve your email address. 

As you register please suffix your username with your department (e.g. username_dft). 

Do not use slack to share data that might be considered 'OFFICIAL' or higher. Please abide by [Social Media guidance fo civil servants](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/social-media-guidance-for-civil-servants/social-media-guidance-for-civil-servants) when using slack.
