# Government Data Science Conference Handbook
This handbook provides advice from previous Government Data Science Conferences in 2019 and 2020.
The event guide is suitable for virtual, hybrid and in-person conferences. Each segment has an adaptation box for the sessions. 
Before starting it's wise to know the date of your conference a year in advance, to ensure that it won't clash with other conferences your community would like to attend.

# Pre-Conference 
This section focuses on plans that need to be made 6-3 months before the conference. 

## Sponsorship 
Annually the Government Data Science Partnership (GDSP) senior members the conference or SCS project sponsor. They provide strategic direction for the conference and budget.

## Community Needs + Accessibility 
The first thing we do is survey the community on topics, format, and expectations for the conference.
Who is your target audience? What have the previously attended? What is there day to day? What do they love? What do they hate? Who would want to come to conference? 
The survey could cover:
* Sub-themes 
* Preferred formats (e.g unconference, pre-surgery.. ) 
* Digital conferencing tools 
* Preferred locations 
* Code of Conduct 
* Conference team volunteering sign up
* Accessibility needs

Making your conference accessible is key to ensuring everyone has good experience. You need to provide an opportunity for speakers and attendees to share their accessibility needs. You can do this via registration form or on pre-conference survey form.

Accessibility needs to consider: 
* Hearing loop 
* Audio-visual guides
* Prayer room
* gender-neutral toilets
* Preferred times 
* Captioning 
* Wheelchair access 
For Speaker presentations please ask that they use a accessibility checker to ensure all attendees can engage with their slides. 

## Creating a team + Delivery Framework
Before asking for team members create a flexible team structure. This should include team roles and reporting structure. Providing as much information ahead, will help with the onboarding of team members.

For the Government Data Science Festival, we used the following structure and roles:

### Core organising team
Support the strand leads by:
*	Coordinating between the leads to ensure strands do not clash and are coherent with the overarching theme
*	Providing advice, guidance and communications tools for the delivery of the festival week
*	Private slack channel for ad-hoc queries and weekly updates 
*	Sourcing volunteers 
This team includes sponsors, project manager, data science lead, business support lead and communications lead.

### Strands Teams 
We had 8 strands focusing on a sub-topic of our core theme. 

Role of a Strand Lead
Lead takes responsibility for the coordinating of a strand. This includes but not limited to:
* Creating a strand blurb on your theme
*	Quality controlling the call for abstracts submissions
*	(If agreed in advance) - inviting speakers 
*	Operational delivering their strand with volunteers and core organising team. Example: hosting the google meets with support of volunteers
* Sourcing volunteers

Role of a strand support
*	Working with the strand lead to quality control call for abstracts 
*	Facilitator of digital platform of choice
*	Collating presentation from speakers in advance of the session    

We used week notes and stand-ups to provide updates on actions. The Strand Leads met every 2 weeks. Core Organising Team twice a week; one session for sponsors and second session for operations team. Key decisions are escalated to the sponsor. 

Now that you have a structure ask your community if they can contribute. It helps to have existing relationships with people or know how they could benefit from taking part. For example, their specialism is data ethics, sifting response would support their cross-public sector knowledge on data ethics in practice. Also, be available for questions and provide flexibility, e.g. person can only sift. 

## Venue or virtual or both 

### Venue 

Calder’s is the official supplier for civil service venues. You can see the venues, you can use via Calder’s Public sector platform.  

Decide the venue features  
*	What do you want and your non negotiables? 
*	Does the venue provide presentation screens? 
*	Does the venue have catering?  
*	Does the venue have step-free access and a hearing loop? Does the venue have a cloakroom? 
*	How many syndicate rooms do we need?  
*	Is the venue within budget? 
*	Do they have a secure WIFI network ?

Submit a query to Calder’s, including all your requirements from syndicate rooms, to room layouts and they will search for you. In your inquiry mentions the venues you may have liked in the first step. Please explicitly encourage them not to get hotel conference venue as these tend to be expensive as they charge based on a delegate rather than the hire of the room itself. 

You will receive a reference code after the Calder’s has completed their search for venues. Please keep this code safe.

In the event you are not happy with the venue search Calder’s, please refer to your initial review of the Calder’s public sector platform. You can do two things:
*	At the bottom of the proposal document there are a list of venues that Calders have made queries with and the list reports the status of the request (e.g. venue not available on the day). Consider if you need to change the dates of the event or the conference. 
*	Or resubmit a query to Calder’s

Once you know the venue you want please include it in the Profession Quality Assurance form and submit this to the sponsors organisation comms. Keep track of the approval and you will receive a code from Comms which will be passed onto to Calder’s. Also ask for Business delivery to provide the codes for confirming the venue. 


## Sifting content

Call for Abstracts sifting 
Lessons from Last year during the call for abstracts sift, the sifters did the following: 

* A spreadsheet was compiled with all the submissions. Sifters could input their thoughts. 
* Each talk was sifted by two people and ranked, the highest ranked talks were discussed first
* They also considered representation of selected presentations, didn’t want to make it London centric 
* It helped for sifters to have a blanked timetable to see the slots they could be added into. They also consider mixing time lengths. (see appendix for an example timesheet)
* Voluntarily ask on the call for abstracts for prospective presenters their gender. We want to ensure gender parity between speakers. 

Developing an agenda
* Section the agenda into blocks of less 45-60 minutes of activity. Between each block leave 10-15 minutes for breaks
* Consider the interactive elements and the ease of handing over to the next speaker when deciding the order of speakers.
* Leave at least 10 minutes for attendees to onboard to the platform 
* Create a contingency time for speakers or technology glips 
* Always schedule a housekeeping section at the beginning and end of a section. Include: Telling the audience about the slido, internal departments security policy (e.g code of conduct)
