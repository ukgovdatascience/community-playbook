# Creating a new area of special interest 


## First 3 months

### Building relationships

Courting relationships: find people in different organisations, who you think could help co-create the community with you. Have one to one chats, and understand their needs and feelings.

### Co-creating a community charter:

A community charter covers: Communities purpose, activities, what member can give and need, frequency, possibility for funding, the culture you want the community to exist in

Case Study: Text Analytics Community Charter development 

For the text analytics community we hosted a meet up to disucss and decide what the community charter looks like. 
We surveyed attendees before the meet up to provide some data as to what they would like from the community, who they are and what digital platforms they have access. You can check out the survey template [Template form Text Analytics Survey](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQ1jsW289jbJ_T_1AUywM8Ujp1xviDC7FaKe3Onmi-NIVpqAUEBOGRcUaa5OzEetpk87eZodgCa4wD0/pub)

The community charter will feed into the community programme and roles

Purpose and ways of working
* What would like to include in the community purpose statement ?
* How do we use community channels such as slack to update and connect the community ?
* How do we facilitate new community ideas ?

Roles and resources
* How would we formalize being an ambassador for the community ?
* What resources should we use to store community knowledge ?
* Are there any other roles we have not considered ?

Behaviours and measures
* How do we cater for all skill sets and proficiency levels ?
* What would you include in a code of conduct to nurture positive relationships ?
* How do we measure success in a community ?
* How will acknowledge members for there work ?
 
The result should be a draft version of a community charter (purpose, vision and the how) (this can be refreshed every year or 6 months).

It's important to note that this is not "bible", that its fluid and should allow room for change.

## At the end of Three Months

### "Official Launch"

- I use the term "official launch" loosely, but it's the launching of the community programme
    - By this time, you should have a team in place and succession structure including community knowledge storing process.
    - Metrics you will use to determine what success looks likes: member satisfaction, content quality and inclusion. This can be measured both quantitatively and qualititavely
    - You can use aspects of programme management and agile delivery to help with the community programme
        - For example, planning in 6 week sprints for meetups, having a community backlog of ideas that generate into stories and features for members to take on

## Engagement and platforms

- Favourite tools:
    - Trello for delivery
    - Eventbrite for managing meet ups
    - Github for sharing code
    - Reading Groups, [Data Kind's Reading group in a box](https://github.com/DataKind-UK/data-ethics-book-club-in-a-box)
    - Slackbots (Donut)
- Pacing
    - What is the rhythm of your community ?
    - How often do you meet etc.
- Cross Community relations
    - It's good to have relationships with community lead, e.g. communities of communities
    - Negotiating boundaries, where does my community start and where does their end ?

## After 9 Months

- Host a community retrospective of what you have achieved so far
    - What have we done, what should stop doing, what should we continue doing
    - Assess engagement of members are certain groups returning
        - Community triangle
        - "Engagement friction" are there any actions you made that created barriers to entry (platform or content), admin deficits
- Provides a time for people to change roles or responsibilities

### Renewal and Change

- Review community charter
    - Celebrate your success
    - Evaluate if your purpose and vision relevant to community ?
- Assess if there is needed for sub-groups within your community
    - Consider how you will facilitate this, could you ideas match ?
- Maturity matrix
